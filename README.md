## Running

To run,

    > make

and open `index.html`. 


## Java Security

Since Java 7, security has tightened and applets no longer run without certificates. This is pretty involved, so I haven't attempted it yet: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/deploy/manifest.html

In fact, it would be easier to just re-write it in JavaScript...
